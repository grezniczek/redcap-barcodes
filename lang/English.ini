barcodes_actiontag_description = "Encodes a string value in a QR code. Apply this action tag to a field of type <b>Text Box</b> (without validation) or <b>File Upload</b> only, and specifiy the name of the source field (which needs to be on the same form) as action tag parameter: @QRCODE=\"source_field\".<br>The value of the source field will be converted to a QR code and stored in the field with the action tag. The storage format will depend on the field type:<ul><li>Text box: Base64-encoded string. This could then be used to produce inline-images with<br><code>&lt;img src=\"data:image/png;base64, [field_with_qrcode]\"></code>.</li><li>File upload: PNG file. This can then be piped with <code>[qr_file:inline]</code> or attached to <i>Alerts</i>.</li></ul>"
